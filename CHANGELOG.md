## v1.9.2 — 2026-03-19
### Changed
- **Default theme**: app now opens in light mode by default (was dark mode). Existing sessions are reset via a storage key bump (`kitab-ui-v2`) so the new default takes effect immediately.

## v1.9.1 — 2026-03-16
### Fixed
- **Amazon link**: switched from direct `/dp/ISBN10` to ISBN search (`?k=ISBN&i=stripbooks`). ISBN search never 404s — Amazon surfaces the product reliably even for delisted or regional editions. Books without an ISBN fall back to title + author search (unchanged). Removed `toIsbn10()` helper and its IIFE wrapper.
- **Wikipedia fallback**: added a second API tier (fulltext `list=search`) before giving up on obscure titles. Tier 1 still tries an exact title match; Tier 2 runs Wikipedia's fulltext search API; Tier 3 falls back to the `w/index.php?search=` page — so the link is never a dead end.
- **External links spacing**: removed `flex-wrap` and increased gap from `gap-2` to `gap-3` — the three buttons (Amazon, Wikipedia, Check Libby) now stay on one consistent row with even spacing.

## v1.9.0 — 2026-03-16
### Changed
- **Amazon link**: upgraded from ISBN search URL to direct product page. ISBN-13 starting with `978` is algorithmically converted to ISBN-10 and linked as `amazon.com/dp/ISBN10`. ISBN-13 starting with `979` (no ISBN-10 equivalent) and books with no ISBN fall back to title+author search.
- **Wikipedia link**: replaced unreliable `opensearch` API with `action=query` direct title lookup. Searches by book title only (author in the query broke matches), validates `pageid > 0` before upgrading the URL, and falls back to a title-only search URL if no article is found.
- **Google Books link**: removed from external links row (low utility).

## v1.8.9 — 2026-03-16
### Changed
- **BookDetail external links**: Replaced Goodreads link with Amazon and Wikipedia links. Amazon uses ISBN when available (`?k=ISBN&i=stripbooks`) or falls back to title + author search. Wikipedia uses the MediaWiki opensearch API to resolve a direct article URL on load, with a search-results fallback if no article is found.

## v1.8.8 — 2026-03-16
### Added
- **Open Library cover fallback in Enrich Library**: When Google Books returns no cover (or no result at all), the enrichment loop now tries Open Library's search API as a second source — first by ISBN, then by title + author. Open Library has a far larger cover database and requires no API key.
- **Per-book selection in Enrich Library**: Results now show a checkbox per book (checked by default for any book with updates). The "Apply All Updates" button is replaced by "Apply X Selected" showing the live count of selected books. A "Select all / Deselect all" toggle sits next to the results count. Books with no data found have a disabled checkbox and a "No data found" label.

## v1.8.7 — 2026-03-16
### Fixed
- **QuickActionsSheet date picker spacing**: Bottom padding increased to 80px when the "When did you finish?" picker is active, lifting the Confirm button well clear of the bottom nav bar
- **"Add a Book" modal clipped by sticky header**: Modal z-index raised above the mobile top bar (z-210 vs z-150), and top offset changed from 5vh (~42px) to 72px so the modal always clears the sticky "Kitab" header cleanly

## v1.8.6 — 2026-03-16
### Changed
- **Global search now offers "Add to library" on empty results**: The search icon (top bar, all pages) already searched your existing library — it now also shows an "Add it to your library" button when nothing is found, pre-filling the Google Books search with your query. Works identically on Home, Library, TBR, Discover, and Rank.
- **Reverted v1.8.5 Dashboard-specific search**: The per-page search sheet was redundant — the Layout's top-bar search icon already covers all pages globally.

## v1.8.5 — 2026-03-16
### Added
- **Library search from Dashboard**: The search icon in the Dashboard header now searches your existing library (by title, author, or tag) in real-time. If the book isn't found, an "Add it to your library" button opens the Google Books search pre-filled with your query. The Plus icon in the header still opens the Add Book flow directly.

## v1.8.4 — 2026-03-16
### Added
- **Barcode scanning to add books**: Tap the barcode icon in the search input to open a fullscreen camera overlay. Scan the ISBN on a book's back cover — if Google Books returns a single match, BookForm opens pre-filled. Multiple editions are shown in the search list; zero results surface the "Add manually" CTA. Uses `@zxing/browser` for reliable EAN-13/EAN-8 decoding on iOS Safari. Consecutive-read confidence gate (2 identical reads) prevents false triggers.

## v1.8.3 — 2026-03-16
### Fixed
- **Library search empty state**: When a search query returns no results, the library now shows `"[query]" isn't in your library.` with an "Add it to your Library" button that opens the Add Book modal — replaces the previous dead-end generic message

## v1.8.2 — 2026-03-16
### Fixed
- **QuickActionsSheet — date picker cut off**: Sheet container now has `maxHeight: 90vh` and `overflowY: auto`, so the Confirm button is always visible on small screens
- **QuickActionsSheet — iOS scroll lock**: Replaced `overflow: hidden` body lock with the `position: fixed` + scroll-position-save/restore approach that works reliably on iOS Safari
- **TBR swipe/scroll conflict**: Inner card defaults to `touch-action: pan-y`; switches to `touch-action: none` the moment a horizontal axis is confirmed, preventing the list from scrolling while a swipe is in progress; restored on touch end
- **BookSearch empty state**: Zero-results state now shows "Book not in Google Books? Add it manually" button, surfacing the manual-add flow instead of a dead-end message

## v1.8.1 — 2026-03-16
### Added
- **AI Recommendations context badge**: A small info line ("X reviews · Y highlights used for context") now appears above the card stack after recommendations load, confirming which personal data was included in the prompt. Hidden if neither reviews nor highlights were available.

## v1.8.0 — 2026-03-16
### Added
- **AI Recommendations**: Prompt now includes user's review excerpts (4-star+ books) and up to 12 Kindle highlights, giving Claude richer context for personalised picks
- **Reading goal gradient bar**: Progress bar on Dashboard and Stats now uses a warm amber gradient (light → deep) to convey heating-up momentum
- **Finish date prompt**: Marking a book as Finished now shows a month/year picker in the Quick Actions sheet before saving; user can skip to omit the date
- **Logout button**: Settings → Account section with a "Log out" button that ends the session and redirects to login
- **Back button in Settings**: Chevron-left button in the Settings header to navigate back to the previous screen

### Changed
- **Enhanced toasts**: Status-change toasts are now context-specific ("Now reading…", "Finished…!", "Added to TBR", "Did not finish") rather than generic
- **Recommendations toast**: Accepting a rec now toasts ""Title" added to your TBR" (deduped against the library add toast via shared id)
- **Pie chart**: Removed clipped inline slice labels; tooltip now shows white text on dark background with book count formatting

## v1.7.0 — 2026-03-16
### Fixed
- `QuickActionsSheet`: date_finished was stored as YYYY-MM-DD instead of YYYY-MM-01 when marking a book as Read via Quick Actions — now uses correct month+year-only format per schema spec
- `ReviewModal`: dead ternary `setText(hasDraft ? dbReview : dbReview)` simplified to `setText(dbReview)`

### Changed
- `StatCard` icons (Dashboard, Stats): replaced all emoji strings (📚 📄 ⭐ 🔖 📏 📌 🔍 📭) with Lucide SVG icons
- `EmptyState` default icon: replaced `'📚'` fallback with `<BookOpen size={48} />` SVG
- Dashboard: "🎉 Goal achieved!" → CheckCircle SVG + text; "Start a book →" arrow → SVG ArrowRight
- Stats: "🎉 Goal achieved!" → CheckCircle SVG + text; EmptyState icon (📊) → BarChart2 SVG
- Rank: winner overlay `✓` → CheckCircle SVG; `⚔️` home screen → Swords SVG; medal emojis 🥇🥈🥉 → CSS-styled numbered badges
- TBR: "View in library →" arrow → SVG ArrowRight; swipe action emoji icons (📖 🗑) → BookOpen/Trash2 SVGs; empty state (📋) → Bookmark SVG
- BookForm: "Edit/Write Review →" arrow → SVG ArrowRight
- BookSearch: "Can't find it? Add manually →" arrow → SVG ArrowRight
- Recommendations: `← Skip  Add to TBR →` → ChevronLeft/ChevronRight SVGs; "✨" EmptyState → Sparkles SVG; "🎉" done state → CheckCircle SVG
- `StatusBadge`: Unicode dot characters (● ○ ◑ ✕) → CSS-styled colored circles using inline styles
- Settings tag deletion: confirm dialog now includes affected book count (e.g. `Delete "Fiction"? This will remove it from 7 books.`)

## v1.6.14 — 2026-03-12
### Added
- `ReviewModal`: dedicated full-screen review editor with tall textarea, word count, spoiler toggle
- Auto-save to localStorage: debounced 500ms, draft survives app reload with a "restore draft?" banner
- Post-read prompt: after marking a book as Finished (via QuickActionsSheet), a modal prompts to write a review (only if no review exists yet)
- BookDetail: "Write Review" / "Edit Review" button in actions row; "Write a Review" empty state when no review exists; inline "Edit" link in review card header
- BookForm: "Write/Edit Review →" callout in the details tab (replaces the removed review tab)

### Changed
- BookForm: removed the "review" tab — review editing now lives in the dedicated ReviewModal
- QuickActionsSheet: "Write/Edit Review" action opens ReviewModal directly instead of BookForm review tab

## v1.6.13 — 2026-03-12
### Changed
- Replaced Readwise sync with direct `My Clippings.txt` import — free, no token required, fully client-side
- Removed `api/readwise-sync.js` serverless function (no longer needed)
- Added `parseClippings` parser and `clippingHash` dedup for Kindle clippings format
- Settings: `ReadwiseSection` replaced with `ClippingsSection` (file upload UI)
- Supabase: `readwise_id` made nullable, `clipping_hash` column added with unique partial index

## v1.6.12 — 2026-03-12
### Fixed
- Settings: version string was rendering inside `TagRow` (once per tag) and `EnrichLibrary` — moved to single canonical location at bottom of Settings
- Stats: `isThisYear()` used `new Date().getFullYear()` which misclassifies January books in US timezones — now uses `parseInt(dateStr.slice(0, 4))`
- utils: same timezone-unsafe date pattern in `computeStats.booksThisYear` — fixed
- Dashboard: removed redundant `computeStats(books)` call on full unfiltered library
- BookDetail: `HighlightsSection` was declared inside `BookDetail`'s function body via hoisting — caused component remount on every parent re-render, resetting the highlights open/close state. Extracted to module level, `isDark` passed as prop
- BookDetail: duplicate `dark:text-ink-300` in metadata grid classNames
- Discover: removed duplicate local `timeAgo()` function, now imports from utils
- Rank: raw Supabase reset didn't invalidate React Query cache — rankings showed stale data after reset. Added `qc.invalidateQueries`
- Settings: `exportCSV` / `exportJSON` created object URLs without revoking — minor memory leak. Added `URL.revokeObjectURL` after download

## v1.6.11 — 2026-03-12
### Fixed
- Kindle Highlights: replaced `dark:bg-ink-800 / dark:text-ink-100` Tailwind variants with inline styles driven by reactive `isDark` state — fixes invisible highlight text in dark mode

## v1.6.11 — 2026-03-12
### Fixed
- Kindle Highlights: replaced one-shot `isDark` with reactive `useState` + `useEffect` / `MutationObserver` so dark-mode state is accurate and updates on theme change
- Kindle Highlights: switched highlight card colors to inline styles so Tailwind purging cannot strip dark-mode values

## v1.6.9 — 2026-03-08
- Fix: BookDetail Highlights section was missing (v1.6.8 component injection
  had a silent failure) — now correctly appended
- Fix: Highlight quote cards had invisible text in dark mode
  (dark:bg-ink-800 + dark:text-ink-100 mismatch) — changed card background
  to dark:bg-teal-900/20 and text to dark:text-paper-100 for legibility

## v1.6.8 — 2026-03-08
- Hotfix: Dashboard.jsx had invalid `require` call from v1.6.7 that broke
  the Vite/ESM build — caused all book detail modals to stop opening
- Feature: Readwise Highlights Sync
  — /api/readwise-sync.js: Vercel serverless proxy for Readwise v2 API
  — src/hooks/useHighlights.js: Supabase queries + sync orchestration + fuzzy matching
  — Settings: Readwise card with token input, Sync button, last-sync time,
    and unmatched-book review queue with manual link-to-book selector
  — BookDetail: collapsible Kindle Highlights section (hidden if 0 highlights)
  — Sync is idempotent (readwise_id unique key) — safe to re-run anytime
  — Token stored in localStorage only; never written to Supabase

## v1.6.8 — 2026-03-07
- Feature: Readwise Highlights Sync
  — New /api/readwise-sync.js Vercel route proxies Readwise v2 API
  — New src/hooks/useHighlights.js with full sync orchestration + fuzzy matching
  — Settings: Readwise card with token input, Sync button, last-sync timestamp,
    and unmatched-book review queue with manual link-to-book selector
  — BookDetail: new Highlights tab showing all Kindle highlights as styled
    quote cards with inline notes and location numbers
  — Sync is idempotent (readwise_id unique key) — safe to run repeatedly
  — Token stored in localStorage only; never written to Supabase

## v1.6.11 — 2026-03-07
- Fix: TBR drag-to-reorder now works on iOS
  — Replaced PointerSensor with MouseSensor (PointerSensor fires on iOS touch,
    racing with TouchSensor and preventing drag activation)
  — Removed touchAction:pan-y from inner card (parent touch-action was overriding
    touch-none on the drag handle child, blocking dnd-kit from receiving events)

## v1.6.10 — 2026-03-07
- Fix: Scroll lock now works on iOS Safari
  — overflow:hidden replaced with position:fixed + scroll position save/restore
  — Applies to all modals (BookForm, BookSearch, etc.) via Modal component
- Fix: TBR drag-to-reorder restored on iOS
  — Removed touch-pan-y from outer sortable container (was blocking dnd-kit TouchSensor)
  — touch-action:pan-y moved to inner card only, so page scroll still works
  — Drag handle retains touch-none so dnd-kit owns those touch events

## v1.6.8 — 2026-03-07
- Fix: Stats page year filter now timezone-safe (Jan books no longer dropped)
  — isThisYear() replaced new Date().getFullYear() with parseInt(dateStr.slice(0,4))
  — Books Read + Pages Read on Statistics page now match Home Dashboard
- Fix: Modal scroll lock added centrally to Modal component in index.jsx
  — Background page no longer scrollable while any modal is open
- Fix: Duplicate "Shuffle Again" button removed from TBR shuffle modal
- Fix: TBR drag-to-reorder restored on iOS
  — PointerSensor now requires 8px movement before activating (prevents swipe conflict)
  — TouchSensor added with 200ms delay + 8px tolerance for reliable touch drag

## v1.6.7 — 2026-03-07
- Change: Dashboard "At a Glance" now shows current-year (2026) stats only
  — Books Read, Pages Read, Avg Rating all scoped to 2026
  — year badge next to "At a Glance" heading
- Fix: Stats page spacing — consistent gap-4 between cards, pb-8 so last
  section has breathing room above nav bar
- Change: Genre stats replaced with Tag stats everywhere
  — Stats page: pie chart + breakdown now show books per tag for 2026
  — Only tags with ≥1 book in current year are shown
  — computeStats now returns tagBreakdown instead of genreBreakdown
- Change: Date collection simplified — removed "Date Started" entirely
  — "Date Finished" replaced with Month + Year dropdown selects
  — Stored as YYYY-MM-01 in existing date_finished column (no migration needed)
  — All downstream stats (booksPerMonth chart, year filter) still work
  — No more day-level precision; pace stats removed

## v1.6.6 — 2026-03-07
- Feature: Loading screen redesigned — stacked book spines (CSS, no images), Playfair
  wordmark, "your reading life" tagline, animated teal ink-dot pulse
- Feature: Statistics page now scoped to current year (2026) only
  — all stats (books, pages, rating, pace, genres, chart) reflect books finished in 2026
  — year badge next to "Statistics" heading
  — empty state message when no books finished yet this year
  — goal progress now uses year-scoped book count (was already year-scoped)
  — replaced "All time" labels with current year labels throughout

## v1.6.5 — 2026-03-07
- Fix: Discover book covers restored — SessionCard rewritten with proper carousel
  (v1.6.4 regex introduced JSX syntax error that broke cover rendering)
  - New carousel: swipe or tap arrows/dots to navigate between picks
  - Robust image fallback: shows title initials if cover URL fails
  - touch-action: pan-y so page scrolling never conflicts with card swipe
  - "Older Recommendations" collapsible for sessions beyond the top 2
- Fix: Shuffle Again button now uses teal background + white text (legible in dark mode)
  — replaced emoji-only button with icon (Shuffle) + "Shuffle Again" label
- Fix: Global double-tap zoom removed via maximum-scale=1 in viewport meta
- Fix: Global 300ms tap delay removed via touch-action: manipulation on all interactive elements

## v1.6.5 — 2026-03-07
- Fix: Discover book covers restored — SessionCard rewritten with proper carousel
  (v1.6.4 regex introduced JSX syntax error that broke cover rendering)
  - New carousel: swipe or tap arrows/dots to navigate between picks
  - Robust image fallback: shows title initials if cover URL fails
  - touch-action: pan-y so page scrolling never conflicts with card swipe
  - "Older Recommendations" collapsible for sessions beyond the top 2
- Fix: Shuffle Again button now uses teal background + white text (legible in dark mode)
  — replaced emoji-only button with icon (Shuffle) + "Shuffle Again" label
- Fix: Global double-tap zoom removed via maximum-scale=1 in viewport meta
- Fix: Global 300ms tap delay removed via touch-action: manipulation on all interactive elements

## v1.6.4 — 2026-03-07
- Feature: Shuffle modal now has "Shuffle Again" button (picks a different book each time)
- Fix: New TBR books are added to the end of the list, not the top
- Fix: Discover carousel swipe no longer fights with page scroll (touch-action: pan-y)
- Perf: Nav bar tap is now instant on iOS (touch-action: manipulation removes 300ms delay)
- Perf: Book grid animations 2x faster (stagger 0.03→0.01, duration 0.3→0.15)
- Perf: React Query staleTime 10min, gcTime 30min — pages load from cache instantly

## v1.6.4 — 2026-03-07
- Feature: Shuffle modal now has "Shuffle Again" button (picks a different book each time)
- Fix: New TBR books are added to the end of the list, not the top
- Fix: Discover carousel swipe no longer fights with page scroll (touch-action: pan-y)
- Perf: Nav bar tap is now instant on iOS (touch-action: manipulation removes 300ms delay)
- Perf: Book grid animations 2x faster (stagger 0.03→0.01, duration 0.3→0.15)
- Perf: React Query staleTime 10min, gcTime 30min — pages load from cache instantly

## v1.6.3 — 2026-03-07
- Change: TBR left swipe now removes book from library entirely (was: mark as done)
  — confirm banner says "Remove from library entirely?" before firing
  — uses useDeleteBook (permanent delete, not status change)
- Feature: Quick Actions now shows full status picker from any context
  — "Status: Currently Reading" row expands to show all 4 statuses
  — auto-sets date_finished when changing to Finished
  — current status marked, can't be re-selected

## v1.6.2 — 2026-03-07
- Fix: Auto-zoom on Discover textarea (iOS zooms inputs <16px font-size; set explicit 16px)
- Fix: Quick Actions menu item text was invisible (now wrapped in explicit <span> with concrete color)
- Fix: Swipe visual feedback not showing (inner card ref now separate from outer container ref)
- Fix: Swipe now shows confirm banner before executing — tap Confirm or Cancel

## v1.6.1 — 2026-03-07
- Fix: Shuffle modal now centered on screen (was rendering too low)
- Fix: Swipe animation no longer janky — swipe offset now written directly to DOM via ref instead of React state, eliminating per-pixel re-renders
- Swipe background tint/label animates smoothly at threshold

# Kitab — Changelog

All changes since inception, in reverse chronological order.

---


## v1.5.4 — March 2026
*Discover scroll conflict fix*

- **Discover: swipe vs. scroll conflict resolved** — card deck now uses `touch-action: pan-y` so the browser owns vertical scrolling natively; horizontal swipe axis is locked only after 8px of movement confirms the gesture is lateral, preventing accidental card swipes while scrolling the page

---


## v1.5.3 — March 2026
*Discover layout fixes*

- **Card perfectly centered** — book cover card is now explicitly centered at fixed width, fully decoupled from the session card padding
- **"Why you'll love it" full width** — reason box now spans the full session card width for a more comfortable reading layout
- **Bottom spacing** — added consistent padding below the session list so the last recommendation clears the nav bar

---


## v1.5.2 — March 2026
*Discover and Rank UI fixes*

- **Discover: modal scroll** — book detail modal now has a fixed height cap; expanding the description scrolls within the modal rather than growing it; X button always accessible
- **Discover: card centered** — recommendation card art properly centered on screen
- **Rank: bottom gap** — added padding below the Rankings list so the Keep Ranking button clears the nav bar

---


## v1.5.1 — March 2026
*Polish pass on v1.5.0 features*

- **Shuffle Pick: Pick Again** — modal now has a "Pick Again" button to reshuffle without closing
- **Rank: Back button** — "Back" link at the top of the Rankings view returns to the main Rank page
- **Discover: recent vs. older split** — sessions from the last 48 hours are expanded by default; older sessions are collapsed under an "Older Recommendations" toggle
- **Discover: expand/collapse icon** — chevron icon on each session header makes expand/collapse behavior explicit
- **Discover: centered card** — recommendation card art is now centered on screen

---


## v1.5.0 — March 2026
*TBR shuffle, Discover card deck, Rank animation*

### New Features
- **Shuffle Pick (TBR)** — new button at the top of TBR randomly surfaces one book from your list in a popup; great for when you can't decide what to read next
- **Discover swipeable card deck** — each recommendation session now displays as an interactive card stack instead of a scrollable list; swipe left/right (or use arrow buttons) to flip through picks; dot indicators show position in the deck
- **Discover card actions** — X button (top-left of card) removes the recommendation with a confirm prompt; checkmark (top-right) adds to TBR with a confirm prompt; tapping the cover opens the full book detail modal
- **Rank reveal animation** — rankings list now builds from the bottom up with a staggered slide-in animation each time results are shown

### Changes
- **TBR buttons removed** — "Reading" and "Done" action buttons removed from TBR rows; swipe gestures are now the primary interaction (swipe right = start reading, swipe left = remove)
- **Discover "Why it's recommended"** — reason text now lives below the active card and animates in/out as you swipe between picks

---

## v1.4.0 — March 2026 (Current)
*Mobile polish, performance, and UX refinement sprint*

### New Features
- **TBR swipe gestures** — swipe right to move to Currently Reading, swipe left to remove from TBR; both directions show a confirmation prompt
- **Tap nav icon to scroll to top** — tapping the active nav icon from any page smoothly scrolls back to the top
- **Collapsible tags in Library filters** — tags are hidden behind a collapsible toggle to prevent the filter panel from growing unwieldy as tag count increases; shows active tag count badge when collapsed
- **Discover: Recent vs. Older sessions** — recommendations split into "recent" (past 48 hours, shown by default) and "older" (collapsed behind a toggle) to declutter the Discover page
- **App version number** — displayed at the bottom of Settings (v1.4.0)

### Fixes & Improvements
- **Mobile auto-zoom disabled** — all inputs, selects, and textareas set to `font-size: 16px` to prevent iOS auto-zoom on focus; applied globally in CSS and patched individually in GlobalSearch, TagInput, BookForm, and BookSearch
- **Edit Book modal layout** — cover column narrowed, Year/Pages fields given compact fixed widths, everything fits without horizontal scrolling on mobile
- **Review tab** — replaced MDEditor (desktop-optimized rich text editor) with a simple `<textarea>` that is much easier to type in on mobile
- **Library overview bottom gap** — added padding below the Library Overview card in Settings so it clears the nav bar properly
- **TBR bottom gap** — added padding below the last TBR item for visual consistency with gaps between items
- **Nav bar z-index** — raised BottomNav to `z-[200]` and added `isolation: isolate` to the scroll container to prevent Framer Motion animated elements from bleeding over the nav bar during scroll
- **BookCard performance** — wrapped in `React.memo`, animation stagger capped at 9 items, entry duration reduced to 0.2s
- **BookCover lazy loading** — added `loading="lazy"` and `decoding="async"` to all cover images

---

## v1.3.0 — March 2026
*AI-powered Discover rebuild*

### New Features
- **LLM-powered recommendations** — Discover feature completely rebuilt from scratch; Claude Haiku generates 5 personalized book recommendations per session
- **Four recommendation modes** — Vibe (✨ mood/atmosphere match), Author (✍️ similar authors), Fresh (🌍 outside usual genres), Favorites (⭐ based on top-rated books)
- **Google Books verification** — every AI recommendation is verified against Google Books before being shown; hallucinated or unverifiable titles are filtered out automatically
- **Session history** — all recommendation sessions saved to Supabase and displayed as collapsible cards on the Discover page
- **Per-book delete** — individual books can be removed from a session without deleting the whole session; deleting the last book removes the session
- **Vercel API proxy** — serverless function at `/api/recommend` holds the Anthropic API key server-side so it is never exposed to the client
- **Desktop two-column layout** — sticky query panel on the left, session history on the right; single-column on mobile with inline query flow

### Fixes
- Kitab logo in header and sidebar converted to home links
- Mobile modal centering fixed (iOS scroll lock, safe-area padding, `position: fixed` scroll restore)
- Duplicate panel bug on mobile fixed

---

## v1.2.0 — March 2026
*Discover v1 (algorithm-based), Libby integration, and UI polish*

### New Features
- **Discover feature (v1)** — three-section recommendation engine: books by similar authors, genre-matched suggestions, and stretch picks outside usual genres; powered by Google Books and Open Library APIs
- **Book preview modal** — tapping a recommendation shows cover, description, author, and publication year before adding to TBR
- **Check Libby button** — available on every book detail and recommendation; links directly to the book's availability on OverDrive/Libby using a configurable library slug in Settings
- **Discover quality improvements** — genre detection, deduplication across sections, quality filtering (excludes study guides/omnibus editions), manual refresh button

---

## v1.1.0 — March 2026
*Dark mode, global search, ELO persistence, and library polish*

### New Features
- **Dark mode** — set as the default theme; toggle available in Settings
- **Global search** — magnifying glass icon in the header opens a full-screen search overlay; searches across titles, authors, tags, and ISBNs across the entire library
