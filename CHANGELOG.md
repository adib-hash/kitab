## v2.4.4 — 2026-04-02

### Fixed
- **iOS Google auth auto-selecting wrong account**: The in-app browser cached credentials and skipped the Google account picker on re-login, causing users to silently sign into the wrong account (empty library). Added `prompt=select_account` to the OAuth URL so Google always shows the account chooser.

## v2.4.3 — 2026-04-01

### Improved
- **Google sign-in reassurance**: Added a subtle note below the "Continue with Google" button explaining that sign-in is secured by Supabase, so users aren't surprised by the unfamiliar Supabase URL during the OAuth redirect.

## v2.4.2 — 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- **iOS Discover — "Load failed" error**: The `/api/recommend` Vercel serverless function was missing CORS headers. iOS Capacitor runs from `capacitor://localhost`, making the API call cross-origin. Added `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` and OPTIONS preflight handling.

## v2.4.1 — 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- **Highlight of the day — expand/collapse**: Long Kindle highlights on the Home page are now clamped to 4 lines with a "Read more" / "Show less" toggle, keeping the dashboard compact. Resets to collapsed when shuffling to a new highlight.
- **iOS Discover — "string did not match expected pattern" error**: The AI recommendation API call used a relative URL (`/api/recommend`) which fails on Capacitor's native webview. Now uses the absolute Vercel URL when running on iOS.

## v2.4.0 — 2026-03-29

### Added
- **Delete a Kindle highlight**: Each highlight card in a book's detail page now has a small trash icon. Tap to permanently remove that highlight from your library.
- **Highlight of the day on Home**: A randomly-selected Kindle highlight is displayed at the top of the Home page (below the reading goal), shown in serif italic with the book title as a tappable link. A shuffle button lets you cycle to another highlight. Only shown when you have highlights synced.
- **Kindle sync on Home page (iOS)**: A "Kindle Highlights" section at the bottom of the Home page lets you sync without digging into Settings. Shows last sync time and a progress indicator while syncing.
- **7-day sync reminder (iOS)**: If it's been a week or more since your last Kindle sync (or you've never synced), an amber reminder banner appears above the sync button on the Home page.
- **Last sync time tracking**: After each successful sync, the timestamp is saved to localStorage. The Home page shows "Last synced today / yesterday / N days ago" so you always know where you stand.

### Changed
- Kindle sync logic extracted into a shared `useKindleSyncFlow` hook used by both Settings and Home — no duplicated code.

## v2.3.2 — 2026-03-29

### Fixed
- **Kindle sync — scraper hangs requiring manual book tap**: The scraper was calling `bookEl.click()` directly on the row container div. Amazon's Kindle notebook page is a React SPA — programmatic `.click()` on a container element doesn't reliably fire React's synthetic event handlers, so the annotations panel would sometimes never appear. The scraper now: (1) scrolls each book into view before clicking, (2) dispatches a full `mousedown` → `mouseup` → `click` event sequence on the most specific clickable child element (a link or the title), which correctly bubbles through React's event system, and (3) retries once on the row itself with a 4s wait if the first attempt gets no response. Total patience before skipping a book: 10 seconds.

## v2.3.1 — 2026-03-29

### Fixed
- **Unmatched book queue — dismiss button**: Added a trash icon button on each unmatched entry to permanently delete those highlights from Supabase. Useful for Kindle books you don't have in your library and don't want cluttering the queue.
- **Unmatched book queue — "Currently Reading" books missing from search**: The manual link combobox was filtered to `status === 'read'` only, so books marked "Currently Reading" never appeared as options and couldn't be linked. Now includes both `read` and `reading` books.
- **"Currently Reading" Kindle highlights not syncing**: Root cause of the above — if auto-matching failed for a currently-reading book and the manual link dropdown excluded it, there was no path to link the highlights. Both the auto-match (which already used all books) and the manual combobox now correctly surface currently-reading books.

## v2.3.0 — 2026-03-29

### Added
- **Settings — version at top**: Version string moved from the bottom of the Settings page to directly under the "Settings" heading. Makes it easy to spot-check that the latest deployment is live without scrolling.
- **Settings — collapsible Manage Tags**: Tags section is now collapsed by default. Tap the header to expand. The header shows the tag count `(N)` when collapsed so you know what's inside without opening it.
- **Kindle Highlights — redesigned unmatched book matching**: Replaced the blind native dropdown (which showed book titles with no context) with an inline searchable combobox. Each unmatched entry now shows the full Kindle title, author, highlight count, and a snippet of the first highlight. Type 2+ characters in the search box to filter your library by title or author and tap a result to link it.

### Fixed
- **Kindle Highlights Sync — incomplete scroll on large libraries**: The scraper previously scrolled a fixed `30 × 400px`, which wasn't enough to reveal all books in large Kindle notebooks. It now scrolls in a loop and stops only when the book list count has been stable for 3 consecutive checks (capped at 30s). Libraries of any size are now fully loaded before scraping begins.
- **Kindle Highlights Sync — pagination wait too short**: Increased the wait after clicking "next page" within a book's annotations from 1.2s to 2.0s, giving Amazon's panel more time to fully render before the scraper reads the next batch.
- **Kindle Highlights Sync — scraper banner**: Banner now updates after scroll to show the number of books found: "Kitab found N books — syncing highlights…", giving better visibility into progress.
- **Kindle Highlights Sync — title/author selector resilience**: Added fallback DOM selectors for book title and author in case Amazon updates their class names.

## v2.2.0 — 2026-03-28
### Fixed
- **Kindle Highlights Sync — new highlights not picked up**: The scraper previously used a fixed 2.5s delay before checking for the book list DOM. Amazon renders the notebook page asynchronously, so fast loads or slow connections could both miss the ready state. The scraper now polls for `#kp-notebook-library` every 500ms for up to 15s, ensuring it always waits for the page to be fully rendered before scraping.
- **Kindle Highlights Sync — books not in DOM**: Before iterating books, the scraper now scrolls the page to the bottom in steps to trigger any lazy-loaded / infinite-scroll book rows, then re-queries the book list. Books that were below the fold are now captured.
- **Kindle Highlights Sync — pagination reliability**: Instead of a fixed 1.5s wait for annotations to appear, the scraper polls for `#kp-notebook-annotations` per-book (up to 6s). Pagination now includes a stale-detection guard (stops if row count doesn't change) and a fallback selector for the "next" button.
- **Kindle Highlights Sync — inflated import count**: `upsertHighlights` now uses `.select('id')` on the Supabase upsert to count only the rows that were *actually inserted* (not duplicates silently skipped by `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`). The toast and status card now show accurate new-highlight counts.

### Changed
- **Kindle Highlights Sync — UX**: Added an instructional tip beneath the section description: "The browser closes automatically when done — you don't need to do anything after logging in." The webview injection delay reduced from 2.5s to 0.8s (scraper handles its own timing internally).
- **Kindle Highlights Sync — in-browser banner**: The injected scraper now adds a sticky teal banner inside the Amazon webview: "Kitab is syncing your highlights — please wait. This window will close automatically."
- **Kindle Highlights Sync — persistent status card**: Replaced the single-line progress text with a persistent status card (spinner → checkmark on success, red on error) that stays visible after the browser closes and shows the final result for 5s.
- **Kindle Highlights Sync — cancel feedback**: Closing the browser before sync completes now shows a toast "Sync cancelled — tap Sync to try again" instead of silently resetting the UI.

### Removed
- **Physical Kindle (My Clippings.txt) sync**: Removed the file-upload option entirely. The unmatched review queue (for books that couldn't be auto-matched) has been moved into the main Kindle Highlights Sync card and now applies to online sync results only.

## v2.1.5 — 2026-03-27
### Known Issue
- **Share Extension — native app book identification**: Attempted fix via `api/resolve-url.js` (server-side redirect resolution + `og:title` extraction) did not resolve the issue. Books shared from the Amazon and Goodreads iOS apps still cannot be identified. To be revisited.

## v2.1.4 — 2026-03-27
### Fixed
- **Share Extension modal**: Centred vertically on screen instead of sliding up from the bottom.
- **Share Extension — native app support**: Kitab now appears in the share sheet of the Amazon and Goodreads iOS apps (not just Safari). Activation rule broadened to match plain-text shares; `ShareViewController` extracts Amazon/Goodreads URLs from shared text using `NSDataDetector`, preferring those domains over any other URLs in the text.

## v2.1.3 — 2026-03-27
### Added
- **Share Extension — Smart Book Preview**: Replaced the manual search flow with an instant auto-lookup. Sharing an Amazon or Goodreads page now opens a pre-populated book card (cover, title, author, year, page count, description) via Google Books API. One tap to add to library with status selection (Want to Read / Reading / Read). "Edit details" opens the full form; "Not the right book?" falls back to manual search.

## v2.1.2 — 2026-03-27
### Fixed
- **Kindle Highlights Sync**: Fixed scraper's `postMessage` calls to wrap data in `{ detail: { ... } }` as required by the `@capgo/inappbrowser` Capacitor bridge. Without this, `event.detail` was `undefined` in the listener and all messages were silently dropped.

## v2.1.1 — 2026-03-27
### Fixed
- **Kindle Highlights Sync**: Fixed "Sync Failed" error on Amazon login. Switched from `InAppBrowser.open()` (SFSafariViewController — no JS injection) to `openWebView()` (WKWebView — JS-injectable). Replaced broken `executeScript()` polling (returns `void`, not values) with `addListener('messageFromWebview')` to receive progress and results from the injected scraper via `window.mobileApp.postMessage()`. Login redirects handled gracefully — scraper re-injects on every page load; `window.__kitabRunning` guard prevents double execution.

## v2.1.0 — 2026-03-27
### Added
- **Kindle Highlights Sync (iOS)**: One-tap sync of all Kindle highlights via `read.amazon.com/kp/notebook`. Opens an in-app browser, injects a scraper, extracts highlights across all books, fuzzy-matches to your library, and stores in Supabase. Sign in to Amazon once; session persists for future syncs. Accessible from Settings (iOS only).
- **iOS Share Extension**: Share any Goodreads or Amazon book page from Safari → Kitab appears in the share sheet → Add Book modal opens with the book title pre-filled from the URL.
- **`kitab://` URL scheme**: Registered in Info.plist to support deep links from the Share Extension.

### Changed
- **Offline mode**: Added `networkMode: 'offlineFirst'` to React Query — cached library data now loads immediately when the app is opened offline instead of showing a loading spinner.
- **Offline mode**: Added 5-second timeout on `getSession()` — app no longer hangs indefinitely on initial load when there's no network connection.
- **Offline mode**: Added `startQueueReplay()` — when the device reconnects, all active queries are invalidated and refreshed.
- **Offline mode (web)**: Added `vite-plugin-pwa` for service worker caching of the web app shell — the web app now loads offline.
- **Kindle Highlights**: Updated Settings description to be iOS-friendly (AirDrop flow for physical Kindle users).

### Removed
- **Biometric login**: Removed Face ID / Touch ID unlock entirely. `@aparajita/capacitor-biometric-auth` dependency removed. `NSFaceIDUsageDescription` removed from Info.plist.

## v2.0.4 — 2026-03-25
### Fixed
- **GlobalSearch scroll conflict**: Opening the search overlay now locks the background page using `position: fixed` + scroll position save/restore. Scrolling within search results no longer scrolls the background page on iOS or web.

## v2.0.3 — 2026-03-25
### Fixed
- **Header blocking overlays**: GlobalSearch raised from z-50 to z-[510] and repositioned to `calc(env(safe-area-inset-top) + 72px)` so it always appears below the header, never behind it.
- **Toast notifications blocked**: Toaster now has `containerStyle` with `top: calc(env(safe-area-inset-top) + 72px)` and `zIndex: 9999` — toasts clear the sticky header on all iOS devices including notched models.
- **Modal z-index and positioning**: Modal backdrop raised to z-[250], content to z-[260]. Hardcoded `top: 72px` replaced with `calc(env(safe-area-inset-top) + 72px)` and `maxHeight` updated to account for safe area.
- **Offline banner z-index**: Raised to z-[9990] to guarantee it sits above all other overlays.

### Performance
- **Book card scroll jank**: Removed framer-motion entrance animations (`opacity + y` stagger) from BookCard — 60+ concurrent animations on large libraries were causing frame drops during scroll. Cards now render instantly.
- **React.memo on BookCard, BookRow, BookCover**: Prevents unnecessary re-renders when filters/search change but individual book data hasn't.
- **Dashboard memoization**: `currentlyReading`, `recentlyRead`, `yearBooks`, and `computeStats` all wrapped in `useMemo` — avoids recomputing derived data on every render.
- **BookCover flicker eliminated**: Cover now initializes with the remote URL immediately; native filesystem cache upgrades it in the background only if a cached version exists.
- **React Query gcTime**: Reduced from 7 days to 24 hours — sufficient for offline use, avoids unnecessary memory growth on large libraries.
- **Vite build**: Added `target: 'esnext'` and explicit `minify: 'esbuild'` for faster, smaller builds.

## v2.0.2 — 2026-03-25
### Fixed
- **Haptic feedback (again)**: replaced lazy dynamic-import pattern with direct static imports. The async module caching in the Vite production build was silently failing on device, keeping all plugin references null. Static imports are the correct pattern for Capacitor plugins.

## v2.0.1 — 2026-03-25
### Fixed
- **Haptic feedback**: all haptics were silently broken due to a typo — `@capacitor/haptics` exports `NotificationType`, not `NotificationStyle`. Every success/warning/error notification haptic was a no-op.
- **Star rating haptic**: replaced `selectionChanged()` with `impactLight()` — `selectionChanged` requires a preceding `selectionStart()` call and is designed for continuous scroll interactions, not discrete taps.

## v2.0.0 — 2026-03-25
### iOS Native Overhaul
- **Safe area fix**: header no longer overlaps the iOS status bar — `env(safe-area-inset-top)` applied to the mobile sticky header in Layout.jsx.
- **Scroll polish**: added `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` and `overscroll-behavior-y: contain` for native momentum scrolling; `-webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent` on all interactive elements; `-webkit-touch-callout: none` on images to suppress long-press context menus.
- **Capacitor config**: `limitsNavigationsToAppBoundDomains: true` prevents accidental navigation to Safari; display name updated to "Kitab".
- **Haptic feedback**: native haptic engine wired to nav taps (light), star ratings (selection), QuickActionsSheet open (medium), add/edit book confirmation (success), DNF/delete actions (warning), TBR drag start (medium). Implemented via `@capacitor/haptics`, no-ops on web.
- **Native cover caching**: book covers fetched and stored to iOS Cache directory via `@capacitor/filesystem`. Library loads instantly with covers even in airplane mode after first load. Web falls back to browser HTTP cache.
- **App icon**: new 1024x1024 icon — teal gradient background, white geometric K lettermark, amber accent dot. Full iOS icon set generated via `@capacitor/assets`.
- **Biometric authentication**: optional Face ID / Touch ID lock via `@aparajita/capacitor-biometric-auth`. Toggle in Settings → Security. Biometrics gates an existing valid Supabase session on cold app open; failed auth signs the user out. Hidden on web.
- **Offline mode**: React Query cache persisted to localStorage (7-day TTL) — library, stats, and dashboard are readable after connectivity drops. `@capacitor/network` monitors real connectivity on device. Offline banner shown across the top of the app. Web app benefits equally from the offline cache.

## v1.9.1 — 2026-03-16
### Fixed
- **Amazon link**: switched from direct `/dp/ISBN10` to ISBN search (`?k=ISBN&i=stripbooks`). ISBN search never 404s — Amazon surfaces the product reliably even for delisted or regional editions. Books without an ISBN fall back to title + author search (unchanged). Removed `toIsbn10()` helper and its IIFE wrapper.
- **Wikipedia fallback**: added a second API tier (fulltext `list=search`) before giving up on obscure titles. Tier 1 still tries an exact title match; Tier 2 runs Wikipedia's fulltext search API; Tier 3 falls back to the `w/index.php?search=` page — so the link is never a dead end.
- **External links spacing**: removed `flex-wrap` and increased gap from `gap-2` to `gap-3` — the three buttons (Amazon, Wikipedia, Check Libby) now stay on one consistent row with even spacing.

## v1.9.0 — 2026-03-16
### Changed
- **Amazon link**: upgraded from ISBN search URL to direct product page. ISBN-13 starting with `978` is algorithmically converted to ISBN-10 and linked as `amazon.com/dp/ISBN10`. ISBN-13 starting with `979` (no ISBN-10 equivalent) and books with no ISBN fall back to title+author search.
- **Wikipedia link**: replaced unreliable `opensearch` API with `action=query` direct title lookup. Searches by book title only (author in the query broke matches), validates `pageid > 0` before upgrading the URL, and falls back to a title-only search URL if no article is found.
- **Google Books link**: removed from external links row (low utility).

## v1.8.9 — 2026-03-16
### Changed
- **BookDetail external links**: Replaced Goodreads link with Amazon and Wikipedia links. Amazon uses ISBN when available (`?k=ISBN&i=stripbooks`) or falls back to title + author search. Wikipedia uses the MediaWiki opensearch API to resolve a direct article URL on load, with a search-results fallback if no article is found.

## v1.8.8 — 2026-03-16
### Added
- **Open Library cover fallback in Enrich Library**: When Google Books returns no cover (or no result at all), the enrichment loop now tries Open Library's search API as a second source — first by ISBN, then by title + author. Open Library has a far larger cover database and requires no API key.
- **Per-book selection in Enrich Library**: Results now show a checkbox per book (checked by default for any book with updates). The "Apply All Updates" button is replaced by "Apply X Selected" showing the live count of selected books. A "Select all / Deselect all" toggle sits next to the results count. Books with no data found have a disabled checkbox and a "No data found" label.

## v1.8.7 — 2026-03-16
### Fixed
- **QuickActionsSheet date picker spacing**: Bottom padding increased to 80px when the "When did you finish?" picker is active, lifting the Confirm button well clear of the bottom nav bar
- **"Add a Book" modal clipped by sticky header**: Modal z-index raised above the mobile top bar (z-210 vs z-150), and top offset changed from 5vh (~42px) to 72px so the modal always clears the sticky "Kitab" header cleanly

## v1.8.6 — 2026-03-16
### Changed
- **Global search now offers "Add to library" on empty results**: The search icon (top bar, all pages) already searched your existing library — it now also shows an "Add it to your library" button when nothing is found, pre-filling the Google Books search with your query. Works identically on Home, Library, TBR, Discover, and Rank.
- **Reverted v1.8.5 Dashboard-specific search**: The per-page search sheet was redundant — the Layout's top-bar search icon already covers all pages globally.

## v1.8.5 — 2026-03-16
### Added
- **Library search from Dashboard**: The search icon in the Dashboard header now searches your existing library (by title, author, or tag) in real-time. If the book isn't found, an "Add it to your library" button opens the Google Books search pre-filled with your query. The Plus icon in the header still opens the Add Book flow directly.

## v1.8.4 — 2026-03-16
### Added
- **Barcode scanning to add books**: Tap the barcode icon in the search input to open a fullscreen camera overlay. Scan the ISBN on a book's back cover — if Google Books returns a single match, BookForm opens pre-filled. Multiple editions are shown in the search list; zero results surface the "Add manually" CTA. Uses `@zxing/browser` for reliable EAN-13/EAN-8 decoding on iOS Safari. Consecutive-read confidence gate (2 identical reads) prevents false triggers.

## v1.8.3 — 2026-03-16
### Fixed
- **Library search empty state**: When a search query returns no results, the library now shows `"[query]" isn't in your library.` with an "Add it to your Library" button that opens the Add Book modal — replaces the previous dead-end generic message

## v1.8.2 — 2026-03-16
### Fixed
- **QuickActionsSheet — date picker cut off**: Sheet container now has `maxHeight: 90vh` and `overflowY: auto`, so the Confirm button is always visible on small screens
- **QuickActionsSheet — iOS scroll lock**: Replaced `overflow: hidden` body lock with the `position: fixed` + scroll-position-save/restore approach that works reliably on iOS Safari
- **TBR swipe/scroll conflict**: Inner card defaults to `touch-action: pan-y`; switches to `touch-action: none` the moment a horizontal axis is confirmed, preventing the list from scrolling while a swipe is in progress; restored on touch end
- **BookSearch empty state**: Zero-results state now shows "Book not in Google Books? Add it manually" button, surfacing the manual-add flow instead of a dead-end message

## v1.8.1 — 2026-03-16
### Added
- **AI Recommendations context badge**: A small info line ("X reviews · Y highlights used for context") now appears above the card stack after recommendations load, confirming which personal data was included in the prompt. Hidden if neither reviews nor highlights were available.

## v1.8.0 — 2026-03-16
### Added
- **AI Recommendations**: Prompt now includes user's review excerpts (4-star+ books) and up to 12 Kindle highlights, giving Claude richer context for personalised picks
- **Reading goal gradient bar**: Progress bar on Dashboard and Stats now uses a warm amber gradient (light → deep) to convey heating-up momentum
- **Finish date prompt**: Marking a book as Finished now shows a month/year picker in the Quick Actions sheet before saving; user can skip to omit the date
- **Logout button**: Settings → Account section with a "Log out" button that ends the session and redirects to login
- **Back button in Settings**: Chevron-left button in the Settings header to navigate back to the previous screen

### Changed
- **Enhanced toasts**: Status-change toasts are now context-specific ("Now reading…", "Finished…!", "Added to TBR", "Did not finish") rather than generic
- **Recommendations toast**: Accepting a rec now toasts ""Title" added to your TBR" (deduped against the library add toast via shared id)
- **Pie chart**: Removed clipped inline slice labels; tooltip now shows white text on dark background with book count formatting

## v1.7.0 — 2026-03-16
### Fixed
- `QuickActionsSheet`: date_finished was stored as YYYY-MM-DD instead of YYYY-MM-01 when marking a book as Read via Quick Actions — now uses correct month+year-only format per schema spec
- `ReviewModal`: dead ternary `setText(hasDraft ? dbReview : dbReview)` simplified to `setText(dbReview)`

### Changed
- `StatCard` icons (Dashboard, Stats): replaced all emoji strings (📚 📄 ⭐ 🔖 📏 📌 🔍 📭) with Lucide SVG icons
- `EmptyState` default icon: replaced `'📚'` fallback with `<BookOpen size={48} />` SVG
- Dashboard: "🎉 Goal achieved!" → CheckCircle SVG + text; "Start a book →" arrow → SVG ArrowRight
- Stats: "🎉 Goal achieved!" → CheckCircle SVG + text; EmptyState icon (📊) → BarChart2 SVG
- Rank: winner overlay `✓` → CheckCircle SVG; `⚔️` home screen → Swords SVG; medal emojis 🥇🥈🥉 → CSS-styled numbered badges
- TBR: "View in library →" arrow → SVG ArrowRight; swipe action emoji icons (📖 🗑) → BookOpen/Trash2 SVGs; empty state (📋) → Bookmark SVG
- BookForm: "Edit/Write Review →" arrow → SVG ArrowRight
- BookSearch: "Can't find it? Add manually →" arrow → SVG ArrowRight
- Recommendations: `← Skip  Add to TBR →` → ChevronLeft/ChevronRight SVGs; "✨" EmptyState → Sparkles SVG; "🎉" done state → CheckCircle SVG
- `StatusBadge`: Unicode dot characters (● ○ ◑ ✕) → CSS-styled colored circles using inline styles
- Settings tag deletion: confirm dialog now includes affected book count (e.g. `Delete "Fiction"? This will remove it from 7 books.`)

## v1.6.14 — 2026-03-12
### Added
- `ReviewModal`: dedicated full-screen review editor with tall textarea, word count, spoiler toggle
- Auto-save to localStorage: debounced 500ms, draft survives app reload with a "restore draft?" banner
- Post-read prompt: after marking a book as Finished (via QuickActionsSheet), a modal prompts to write a review (only if no review exists yet)
- BookDetail: "Write Review" / "Edit Review" button in actions row; "Write a Review" empty state when no review exists; inline "Edit" link in review card header
- BookForm: "Write/Edit Review →" callout in the details tab (replaces the removed review tab)

### Changed
- BookForm: removed the "review" tab — review editing now lives in the dedicated ReviewModal
- QuickActionsSheet: "Write/Edit Review" action opens ReviewModal directly instead of BookForm review tab

## v1.6.13 — 2026-03-12
### Changed
- Replaced Readwise sync with direct `My Clippings.txt` import — free, no token required, fully client-side
- Removed `api/readwise-sync.js` serverless function (no longer needed)
- Added `parseClippings` parser and `clippingHash` dedup for Kindle clippings format
- Settings: `ReadwiseSection` replaced with `ClippingsSection` (file upload UI)
- Supabase: `readwise_id` made nullable, `clipping_hash` column added with unique partial index

## v1.6.12 — 2026-03-12
### Fixed
- Settings: version string was rendering inside `TagRow` (once per tag) and `EnrichLibrary` — moved to single canonical location at bottom of Settings
- Stats: `isThisYear()` used `new Date().getFullYear()` which misclassifies January books in US timezones — now uses `parseInt(dateStr.slice(0, 4))`
- utils: same timezone-unsafe date pattern in `computeStats.booksThisYear` — fixed
- Dashboard: removed redundant `computeStats(books)` call on full unfiltered library
- BookDetail: `HighlightsSection` was declared inside `BookDetail`'s function body via hoisting — caused component remount on every parent re-render, resetting the highlights open/close state. Extracted to module level, `isDark` passed as prop
- BookDetail: duplicate `dark:text-ink-300` in metadata grid classNames
- Discover: removed duplicate local `timeAgo()` function, now imports from utils
- Rank: raw Supabase reset didn't invalidate React Query cache — rankings showed stale data after reset. Added `qc.invalidateQueries`
- Settings: `exportCSV` / `exportJSON` created object URLs without revoking — minor memory leak. Added `URL.revokeObjectURL` after download

## v1.6.11 — 2026-03-12
### Fixed
- Kindle Highlights: replaced `dark:bg-ink-800 / dark:text-ink-100` Tailwind variants with inline styles driven by reactive `isDark` state — fixes invisible highlight text in dark mode

## v1.6.11 — 2026-03-12
### Fixed
- Kindle Highlights: replaced one-shot `isDark` with reactive `useState` + `useEffect` / `MutationObserver` so dark-mode state is accurate and updates on theme change
- Kindle Highlights: switched highlight card colors to inline styles so Tailwind purging cannot strip dark-mode values

## v1.6.9 — 2026-03-08
- Fix: BookDetail Highlights section was missing (v1.6.8 component injection
  had a silent failure) — now correctly appended
- Fix: Highlight quote cards had invisible text in dark mode
  (dark:bg-ink-800 + dark:text-ink-100 mismatch) — changed card background
  to dark:bg-teal-900/20 and text to dark:text-paper-100 for legibility

## v1.6.8 — 2026-03-08
- Hotfix: Dashboard.jsx had invalid `require` call from v1.6.7 that broke
  the Vite/ESM build — caused all book detail modals to stop opening
- Feature: Readwise Highlights Sync
  — /api/readwise-sync.js: Vercel serverless proxy for Readwise v2 API
  — src/hooks/useHighlights.js: Supabase queries + sync orchestration + fuzzy matching
  — Settings: Readwise card with token input, Sync button, last-sync time,
    and unmatched-book review queue with manual link-to-book selector
  — BookDetail: collapsible Kindle Highlights section (hidden if 0 highlights)
  — Sync is idempotent (readwise_id unique key) — safe to re-run anytime
  — Token stored in localStorage only; never written to Supabase

## v1.6.8 — 2026-03-07
- Feature: Readwise Highlights Sync
  — New /api/readwise-sync.js Vercel route proxies Readwise v2 API
  — New src/hooks/useHighlights.js with full sync orchestration + fuzzy matching
  — Settings: Readwise card with token input, Sync button, last-sync timestamp,
    and unmatched-book review queue with manual link-to-book selector
  — BookDetail: new Highlights tab showing all Kindle highlights as styled
    quote cards with inline notes and location numbers
  — Sync is idempotent (readwise_id unique key) — safe to run repeatedly
  — Token stored in localStorage only; never written to Supabase

## v1.6.11 — 2026-03-07
- Fix: TBR drag-to-reorder now works on iOS
  — Replaced PointerSensor with MouseSensor (PointerSensor fires on iOS touch,
    racing with TouchSensor and preventing drag activation)
  — Removed touchAction:pan-y from inner card (parent touch-action was overriding
    touch-none on the drag handle child, blocking dnd-kit from receiving events)

## v1.6.10 — 2026-03-07

# Kitab — Changelog

All changes since inception, in reverse chronological order.

---

## v1.6.0 — March 2026
*Quick Actions via long press*

- **Long press any book** — hold a book card (Library grid or TBR list) 500ms to open a Quick Actions bottom sheet
- **Quick Actions**: Add/Edit Tags, Write/Edit Review, Rate (inline star picker), Move to Currently Reading / TBR
- **iOS context menu suppressed** — `onContextMenu` + `WebkitTouchCallout: none` block the system "Open in New Tab" popup
- **Swipe + long press coexist on TBR** — 8px movement threshold cancels long-press timer; swipe gestures are unaffected

---


## v1.5.4 — March 2026
*Discover scroll conflict fix*

- **Discover: swipe vs. scroll conflict resolved** — card deck now uses `touch-action: pan-y` so the browser owns vertical scrolling natively; horizontal swipe axis is locked only after 8px of movement confirms the gesture is lateral, preventing accidental card swipes while scrolling the page

---


## v1.5.3 — March 2026
*Discover layout fixes*

- **Card perfectly centered** — book cover card is now explicitly centered at fixed width, fully decoupled from the session card padding
- **"Why you'll love it" full width** — reason box now spans the full session card width for a more comfortable reading layout
- **Bottom spacing** — added consistent padding below the session list so the last recommendation clears the nav bar

---


## v1.5.2 — March 2026
*Discover and Rank UI fixes*

- **Discover: modal scroll** — book detail modal now has a fixed height cap; expanding the description scrolls within the modal rather than growing it; X button always accessible
- **Discover: card centered** — recommendation card art properly centered on screen
- **Rank: bottom gap** — added padding below the Rankings list so the Keep Ranking button clears the nav bar

---


## v1.5.1 — March 2026
*Polish pass on v1.5.0 features*

- **Shuffle Pick: Pick Again** — modal now has a "Pick Again" button to reshuffle without closing
- **Rank: Back button** — "Back" link at the top of the Rankings view returns to the main Rank page
- **Discover: recent vs. older split** — sessions from the last 48 hours are expanded by default; older sessions are collapsed under an "Older Recommendations" toggle
- **Discover: expand/collapse icon** — chevron icon on each session header makes expand/collapse behavior explicit
- **Discover: centered card** — recommendation card art is now centered on screen

---


## v1.5.0 — March 2026
*TBR shuffle, Discover card deck, Rank animation*

### New Features
- **Shuffle Pick (TBR)** — new button at the top of TBR randomly surfaces one book from your list in a popup; great for when you can't decide what to read next
- **Discover swipeable card deck** — each recommendation session now displays as an interactive card stack instead of a scrollable list; swipe left/right (or use arrow buttons) to flip through picks; dot indicators show position in the deck
- **Discover card actions** — X button (top-left of card) removes the recommendation with a confirm prompt; checkmark (top-right) adds to TBR with a confirm prompt; tapping the cover opens the full book detail modal
- **Rank reveal animation** — rankings list now builds from the bottom up with a staggered slide-in animation each time results are shown

### Changes
- **TBR buttons removed** — "Reading" and "Done" action buttons removed from TBR rows; swipe gestures are now the primary interaction (swipe right = start reading, swipe left = remove)
- **Discover "Why it's recommended"** — reason text now lives below the active card and animates in/out as you swipe between picks

---

## v1.4.0 — March 2026 (Current)
*Mobile polish, performance, and UX refinement sprint*

### New Features
- **TBR swipe gestures** — swipe right to move to Currently Reading, swipe left to remove from TBR; both directions show a confirmation prompt
- **Tap nav icon to scroll to top** — tapping the active nav icon from any page smoothly scrolls back to the top
- **Collapsible tags in Library filters** — tags are hidden behind a collapsible toggle to prevent the filter panel from growing unwieldy as tag count increases; shows active tag count badge when collapsed
- **Discover: Recent vs. Older sessions** — recommendations split into "recent" (past 48 hours, shown by default) and "older" (collapsed behind a toggle) to declutter the Discover page
- **App version number** — displayed at the bottom of Settings (v1.4.0)

### Fixes & Improvements
- **Mobile auto-zoom disabled** — all inputs, selects, and textareas set to `font-size: 16px` to prevent iOS auto-zoom on focus; applied globally in CSS and patched individually in GlobalSearch, TagInput, BookForm, and BookSearch
- **Edit Book modal layout** — cover column narrowed, Year/Pages fields given compact fixed widths, everything fits without horizontal scrolling on mobile
- **Review tab** — replaced MDEditor (desktop-optimized rich text editor) with a simple `<textarea>` that is much easier to type in on mobile
- **Library overview bottom gap** — added padding below the Library Overview card in Settings so it clears the nav bar properly
- **TBR bottom gap** — added padding below the last TBR item for visual consistency with gaps between items
- **Nav bar z-index** — raised BottomNav to `z-[200]` and added `isolation: isolate` to the scroll container to prevent Framer Motion animated elements from bleeding over the nav bar during scroll
- **BookCard performance** — wrapped in `React.memo`, animation stagger capped at 9 items, entry duration reduced to 0.2s
- **BookCover lazy loading** — added `loading="lazy"` and `decoding="async"` to all cover images

---

## v1.3.0 — March 2026
*AI-powered Discover rebuild*

### New Features
- **LLM-powered recommendations** — Discover feature completely rebuilt from scratch; Claude Haiku generates 5 personalized book recommendations per session
- **Four recommendation modes** — Vibe (✨ mood/atmosphere match), Author (✍️ similar authors), Fresh (🌍 outside usual genres), Favorites (⭐ based on top-rated books)
- **Google Books verification** — every AI recommendation is verified against Google Books before being shown; hallucinated or unverifiable titles are filtered out automatically
- **Session history** — all recommendation sessions saved to Supabase and displayed as collapsible cards on the Discover page
- **Per-book delete** — individual books can be removed from a session without deleting the whole session; deleting the last book removes the session
- **Vercel API proxy** — serverless function at `/api/recommend` holds the Anthropic API key server-side so it is never exposed to the client
- **Desktop two-column layout** — sticky query panel on the left, session history on the right; single-column on mobile with inline query flow

### Fixes
- Kitab logo in header and sidebar converted to home links
- Mobile modal centering fixed (iOS scroll lock, safe-area padding, `position: fixed` scroll restore)
- Duplicate panel bug on mobile fixed

---

## v1.2.0 — March 2026

### New Features
- **Discover feature (v1)** — three-section recommendation engine: books by similar authors, genre-matched suggestions, and stretch picks outside usual genres; powered by Google Books and Open Library APIs
- **Book preview modal** — tapping a recommendation shows cover, description, author, and publication year before adding to TBR
- **Check Libby button** — available on every book detail and recommendation; links directly to the book's availability on OverDrive/Libby using a configurable library slug in Settings
- **Discover quality improvements** — genre detection, deduplication across sections, quality filtering (excludes study guides/omnibus editions), manual refresh button

---
